[English](README.md) | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

Home Assistant custom integration for China Southern Power Grid electricity data.

This project is a fork of [CubicPill/china_southern_power_grid_stat](https://github.com/CubicPill/china_southern_power_grid_stat).
It uses the `csg` integration domain and redesigns the entities for correct Home
Assistant statistics and Energy dashboard use.

## Features

- Supports accounts in the China Southern Power Grid service area: Guangdong,
  Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Hainan.
- Supports SMS, SMS plus password, CSG App QR code, WeChat QR code, and Alipay
  QR code login.
- Supports multiple CSG accounts and multiple payment accounts per CSG account.
- Uses Home Assistant's UI configuration flow; YAML configuration is not supported.
- Keeps the full payment account number in device and entity names.

## Data freshness

The following classifications follow the upstream integration README and its API
mapping. They describe data freshness, not endpoint naming.

| Data | Source | Freshness |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Balance and arrears | `queryUserAccountNumberSurplus` | Realtime |
| Current ladder tier, remaining allowance, and tariff | `queryDayElectricChargeByMPoint` ladder fields | Realtime |
| Yesterday's electricity usage | `queryDayElectricByMPointYesterday` | Realtime |
| Daily usage, daily cost, monthly totals | `queryDayElectricByMPoint` and `queryDayElectricChargeByMPoint` | Delayed by about two days for the current month |
| Current and previous year totals | `getAnalyzeFeeDetails` | Non-realtime; current year is updated through the previous month |

“Realtime” yesterday usage is still a daily value. It is not live power or
today's accumulated consumption.

## Entities

Each payment account provides the following sensors:

- Energy total: cumulative `kWh` for the Home Assistant Energy dashboard.
- Settled cost total: cumulative `CNY` cost for Energy dashboard cost tracking.
- Yesterday usage, balance, and arrears.
- Current ladder tier, remaining energy, and tariff.
- Latest settlement-day usage and cost.
- This month, last month, this year, and last year usage and cost totals.

Only **Energy total** and **Settled cost total** use the
`total_increasing` state class. All query snapshots use `measurement` or no
state class, so Home Assistant does not mistake a monthly or yearly snapshot
for a continuously increasing meter.

## Energy dashboard and billing corrections

Energy total advances smoothly through the current day using the latest complete
daily reading as its rate. The ledger remains based on complete daily readings,
so this interpolation is only for the live entity value. When the delayed
daily bill becomes available, the integration compares its `result[].power` and
`result[].charge` values with stored data and corrects existing Home Assistant
Recorder statistics for that date.

The cumulative entities never decrease: historical bill corrections update the
Recorder's historical sums rather than resetting a `total_increasing` meter.
The first installation does not fabricate historical entity states from an old
bill. Cost is taken only from the settled daily `charge` value; the current
ladder tariff is never used to estimate cost.

To configure Home Assistant Energy, select:

- **Energy total** as the electricity consumption source.
- **Settled cost total** as the entity-with-total-cost source.

## Installation

Install through [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) or download a release from
[orangeboyChen/ha-csg](https://github.com/orangeboyChen/ha-csg/releases).

Home Assistant `2024.4` or newer is required.

## Breaking upgrade to v2

Version 2 changes the integration domain from
`china_southern_power_grid_stat` to `csg`. There is no automatic migration.

1. Remove the old integration.
2. Restart Home Assistant.
3. Add **CSG** again and configure the account.
4. Remove old devices, entities, and historical statistics if they are no longer needed.

## Update intervals

Balance, arrears, ladder state, and yesterday usage refresh at the configured
interval (four hours by default). Daily billing details, monthly summaries, and
yearly summaries refresh once per day.

## API implementation

[`custom_components/csg/csg_client/__init__.py`](custom_components/csg/csg_client/__init__.py)
implements the CSG App API and can be used independently. See
`csg_client_demo.py` for a basic example.
